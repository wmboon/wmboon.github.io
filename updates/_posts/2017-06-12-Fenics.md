My presentation "Mixed-Dimensional Linear Elasticity with Relaxed Symmetry" was awarded *best PhD presentation* at the FEniCS 2017 conference. Jack Hale mentioned my talk in [this blog](https://numfocus.org/blog/fenics-conference-2017-in-review):

> Wietse Boonâ€™s presentation on compatible finite element discretisation spaces for mixed dimensional elasticity problems. These mathematical developments will allow accurate simulation of complex phenomena like the mechanical response of carbon nanotubes embedded in a rubber matrix.
