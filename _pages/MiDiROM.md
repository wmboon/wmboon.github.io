MiDiROM is the acronym of my Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship, a project that develops Reduced Order Models for Mixed-Dimensional PDEs.

For the official status and results of the project, see the following website of [the European Commission](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101031434).
