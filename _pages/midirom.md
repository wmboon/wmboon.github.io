MiDiROM is the acronym of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action Individual Fellowship in which we develop Reduced Order Models for Mixed-Dimensional PDEs related to geo-thermal energy storage.

The blog posts below contain summaries of each manuscript written within the MiDiROM project.
For the official status and results of the project, see the [dedicated website of the European Commission](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101031434).
