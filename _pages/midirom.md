MiDiROM is the acronym of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action Individual Fellowship in which we develop Reduced Order Models for Mixed-Dimensional PDEs.

For the official status and results of the project, see the following website of [the European Commission](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101031434).
