## Summary

- We model the contractive effects of fibroblasts on dermal tissue using point sources in an elastic medium. 
- The equations are analyzed using weighted Sobolev spaces and two finite element methods are proposed.

### Corrigendum

It has been pointed out in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aml.2024.109258) by Allendes et al. that there is a mistake in the proofs of Lemma 3.2 and Theorems 3.3 & 3.4. The interested reader is referred to that paper for a rectification of the error.
