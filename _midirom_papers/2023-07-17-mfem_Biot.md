## Key ideas

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/midirom_papers/deRham_Biot.png" caption="The finite element spaces for solid rotation, solid displacement, fluid flux, and fluid pressure. Both the solid rotation and fluid flux are eliminated locally, resulting in a scheme with one degree of freedom per facet and cell." %}

## Main findings
- A drawback is that the formulation is based on unconventional boundary conditions and currently does not directly handle traction conditions.
