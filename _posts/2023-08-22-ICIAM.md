I presented our recent work on ``Multipoint mixed finite elements for Stokes flow and Biot poroelasticity using rotation-based formulations'' at the International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics this week.

The talk summarizes the results in our papers on multipoint mixed finite elements for [Stokes flow](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aml.2022.108498) and [Biot poroelasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12448).
