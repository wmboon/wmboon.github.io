Together with Martin Hornkjøl, Miroslav Kuchta, and Ricardo Ruiz-Baier, we organized the minisymposium [Robust formulations for coupled multiphysics problems – Theory and applications](https://iciam2023.org/registered_data?id=00319) at the International Congress of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) this week. The minisymposium consisted of 5 sessions with 20 speakers from across the world.

In one of the sessions, I gave a talk on our recent work on ``Multipoint mixed finite elements for [Stokes flow](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aml.2022.108498) and [Biot poroelasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12448) using rotation-based formulations''.
