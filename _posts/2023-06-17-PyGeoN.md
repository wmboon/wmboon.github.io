We released a new version of our open-source software [PyGeoN: A Python package for Geo-Numerics](https://github.com/compgeo-mox/pygeon).
This release features several new discretization schemes, including the nodal Lagrange Virtual element on polygons and the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini element on simplices.
