For the next two years, I will work as the Dahlquist Fellow at the Numerical Analysis division of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

> Wietse Boon has been awarded the Dahlquist research fellowship for his important contributions to numerical methods for mixed-dimensional partial differential equations with applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics, in particular flow in fractured porous media. A central part of his work is the development of mixed finite element methods on hierarchical domains. He is using deep and thorough analysis guaranteeing stability and accuracy, which is also verified by computational implementations.

More information on the fellowship can be found on the [official webpage](https://www.kth.se/math/the-dahlquist-resear/the-dahlquist-research-fellowship-1.856773).
