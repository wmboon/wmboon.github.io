title: "PhD Defense"

My PhD thesis at the University of Bergen focused on "Conforming Discretizations of Mixed-Dimensional Partial Differential Equations." The research aimed to understand fluid flow through fractures in rocks, crucial for technologies like geothermal energy and CO2 storage. The study modeled fractures as 2D surfaces within 3D rocks and developed mathematical models to simulate fluid flow. The research introduced a framework for analyzing mixed-dimensional partial differential equations, valuable for simulating heat and pollutant transport in subsurface systems.
