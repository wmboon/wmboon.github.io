As of today, I am the Principal Investigator of the research project *I-01: Efficient iterative solution methods for coupled free-flow and porous-media flow problems*, which is part of the collaborative research centre *SFB1313: Interface-Driven Multi-Field Processes in Porous Media â€“ Flow, Transport and Deformation*. The [SFB1313 website](https://www.sfb1313.uni-stuttgart.de/project-structure/internal-projects/i-01/) contains detailed information about the project.
