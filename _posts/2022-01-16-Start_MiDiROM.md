Today marks the start of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action Individual Fellowship grant MiDiROM: Deep learning enhanced numerical simulations of mixed-dimensional models for subsurface flow. I will be working on this project at MOX at the Politecnico di Milano for the next two years.

The results of this projcect will be posted on [this webpage](/midirom)
