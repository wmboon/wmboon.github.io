[SIAM News](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/june-2021-prize-spotlight#wb) interviewed me as the awardee of the 2021 Early Career prize of SIAG/GS.

This prize is awarded every two years to one individual in their early career in the field of geosciences for distinguished contributions to the field in the three calendar years prior to the award year. My award reads as follows:
> For novel and significant contributions to the challenging problem of mathematical and computational modeling of mixed-dimensional systems, such as fractured porous media.
