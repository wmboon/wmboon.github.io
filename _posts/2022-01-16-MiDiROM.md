title: "Start of MiDiROM"

Today marks the start of my Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action Individual Fellowship grant MiDiROM: Deep learning enhanced numerical simulations of mixed-dimensional models for subsurface flow. I will be working on this project at MOX at the Politecnico di Milano for the next two years.

The official website of the [European Commission](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101031434) contains more details concerning the project structure.
