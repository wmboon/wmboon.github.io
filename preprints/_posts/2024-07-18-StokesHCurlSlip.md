## Summary

- We consider an alternative formulation for the Stokes problem in which the velocity is sought in H(curl). 
- Enforcing Navier-slip boundary conditions in the H(curl)-based setting is non-trivial, but it can be done by considering it as a Robin boundary condition.
- We prove well-posedness of the continuous problem using compact perturbation theory.
- The discrete problem is analyzed using a curl-preserving lifting operator and we derive a priori error estimates for the discrete solution.
- Numerical results validate the predicted convergence rates.
