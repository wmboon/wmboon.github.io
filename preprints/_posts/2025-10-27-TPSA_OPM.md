We illustrate the advantages of coupling two finite volume methods to solve the Biot poroelasticity equations. 
- A fixed stress coupling scheme is proposed between OPM Flow and an external Two-Point Stress Approximation (TPSA) code. 
- Both methods concern cell-centered variables, so the information passed between the two codes consists of only one value per cell per time step. 
- Efficient solvers for the Two-Point Flux method can be reused for TPSA.
- Numerical examples showcase the flexibility and applicability of the approach on complex corner-point grids.
